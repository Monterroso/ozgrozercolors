# Technical Specification

## System Overview
The system is a web application designed to manage and interact with color palettes. Users can create, edit, save, and share color palettes. The application features a chat interface powered by either rule-based logic or an external Large Language Model (LLM) for suggesting colors and providing palette analysis. The system comprises frontend components, context providers for state management, and services for chat functionality.

### Main Components and Their Roles
- **Frontend Components:** React components for UI elements such as `App`, `ChatModal`, `ChatSettingsModal`, `ColorItem`, `ColorPicker`, `Colors`, `CopyButton`, `ExportModal`, `ExportModalTabs`, `Formik`, `Header`, `ImportModal`, `LoadModal`, `NewColorButtons`, `SaveModal`, and `ShareModal`.
- **Context Providers:** `AppContext` for global state management.
- **Services:** `ChatService` for processing chat messages and suggesting colors.
- **External APIs:** Integration with an external LLM for advanced color suggestions.

## Core Functionality
### Primary Features and Their Implementation
1. **Color Palette Management:**
   - **`components/App.jsx`:** Initializes the application state by loading color palettes and selected palette ID from cookies.
   - **`components/Colors.jsx`:** Manages the display and reordering of color items.
   - **`components/ColorItem.jsx`:** Represents an individual color item, handling display, dragging, and removal.
   - **`components/ColorPicker.jsx`:** Manages the display and interaction of a color picker.
   - **`components/NewColorButtons.jsx`:** Provides buttons to add new colors between existing ones.

2. **Chat Interface:**
   - **`components/ChatModal.jsx`:** Handles the chat interface, including sending messages, displaying chat history, and managing settings.
   - **`services/ChatService.js`:** Abstract base class and concrete implementations for processing chat messages and suggesting colors.

3. **Settings Management:**
   - **`components/ChatSettingsModal.jsx`:** Manages the settings for the chat assistant, including toggling the use of an external LLM and setting API endpoints and keys.
   - **`contexts/AppContext.jsx`:** React context for managing global application state, including LLM settings loaded from `localStorage`.

4. **Export and Import Functionality:**
   - **`components/ExportModal.jsx` and `components/ExportModalTabs.jsx`:** Modals for exporting color palettes in various formats.
   - **`components/ImportModal.jsx`:** Modal for importing color palettes from text input.

5. **Sharing Functionality:**
   - **`components/ShareModal.jsx`:** Modal that allows users to share a color palette by constructing a URL with the color palette.

### Complex Algorithms and Business Logic
- **Color Suggestion Algorithms:**
  - **`services/ChatService.js`:** Implements `RuleChatService` and `LLMChatService` for suggesting colors based on rules or external LLM responses.
  - **`functions/calculateNewColor.js`:** Calculates a new color based on the provided array of colors and an index.

- **Color Name Matching:**
  - **`functions/ntc.js`:** Matches input colors to the closest predefined color name using a distance formula.

- **UUID Generation:**
  - **`functions/uuid.js`:** Generates a UUID using a combination of timestamp and random values.

## Architecture
### Data Flow Patterns
1. **Initialization:**
   - The `App` component initializes the application state by loading color palettes and selected palette ID from cookies using `getCookie` and `setState`.

2. **User Interaction:**
   - Users interact with the UI components to manage color palettes (`Colors`, `ColorItem`, `ColorPicker`).
   - Chat interactions are handled by `ChatModal`, which sends messages to `ChatService` for processing.

3. **State Management:**
   - Global state is managed using `AppContext`, which provides state and `setState` to all components.
   - LLM settings are loaded from `localStorage` and managed within `AppContext`.

4. **Export and Import:**
   - Color palettes can be exported using `ExportModal` and `ExportModalTabs`, which generate color variable strings.
   - Palettes can be imported using `ImportModal`, which parses and sets new colors from the input text.

5. **Sharing:**
   - The `ShareModal` constructs a URL with the color palette for sharing, utilizing the global state from `AppContext`.

### End-to-End Data Flow
- Users load the application, which initializes the state from cookies.
- Users interact with the UI to manage color palettes and chat with the assistant.
- The application processes chat messages using `ChatService` and updates the global state accordingly.
- Users can export, import, and share color palettes, with the application managing the state and generating necessary URLs or strings.
